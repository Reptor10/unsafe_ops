### Prerequisites
- C Library Development Environment
- Basic Knowledge of Low-Level Design

## Features
- Direct Memory Access Support
- Low-Level Programming Tools
- Hardware-specific Optimizations
- Unsafe Code Execution
- Cross-Architecture Compatibility

## Usage
1. **Direct Memory Access**: Use the library functions to directly access memory locations for performance-critical operations.
   
   ```c
   #include <unsafe_ops.h>
   
   // Read from a specific memory address
   uint32_t data = unsafe_read_memory(0x1000);
   ```

2. **Low-Level Programming**: Leverage the provided APIs for low-level hardware interactions tailored for different architectures.
   
   ```c
   #include <unsafe_ops.h>
   
   // Write to a hardware register
   unsafe_write_register(0x2000, 0xFF);
   ```

3. **Optimizations**: Employ the library for optimizing performance in embedded systems and applications requiring fine-tuning of hardware operations.

   ```c
   #include <unsafe_ops.h>
   
   // Perform architecture-specific optimizations
   unsafe_optimize_performance(ARM);
   ```
